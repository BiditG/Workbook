Suggestions for Developing your code submission for coursework part 2 

1. Complete your code in the first code cell in activity 4 of workbook 6.
 - the 'jupyter magics' on the first line of the cell  will save all the rest of your code in that cell  to a file called 'myVisualiser.py"
 - then run the second code cell in actibity 4 and make sure you get a visualidation as you expect.
 
 
 2. Copy your file "myVisualiser.py" into this directory
 - this will remove any unexpected side effects due ot runnig in a jupyter notebook
 
 3. Use the command:
python 3 pre_submission_test.py
This  will run a test script to try and use your code.
It is based on the code used in the marking system.
It will give you feedback if it encounters any errors or problems,
which mean you would score 0, but will not give you a mark.
