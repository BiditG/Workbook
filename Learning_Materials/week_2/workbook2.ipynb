    "Overview of activities and objectives of this workbook:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The first part of this workbook will implement the Depth-first and Breadth-first search algorithms.\n",
    "    - We will test the algorithms on the combination lock problem from last week.\n",
    "    - We provide an implementation of the pseudocode from the lectures.\n",
    "    - This will give you experience **implementing** and **testing** the algorithms within a common code framework that we provide.\n",
    "    - This will also help to build your python skills and confidence with using and adapting other people's code.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The second part of this workbook give you hands-on experience of **extending**  algorithms to different contexts.\n",
    "    - In this case, adapting depth-first search to try and make it work for the fox-chicken-grain problem."
