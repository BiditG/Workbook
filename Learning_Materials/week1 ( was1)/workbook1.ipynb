    "### making arrays full of zeros/ones etc\n",

    "\n",
    "### Statistics that describe contents:mean, max and min\n",
    "- if we call ```np.mean(myarray)```,  ```np.max(myarray)``` or ```np.min(myarray)``` on a 1D array we. get what you would expect\n",
    "- if we call the methods on a N-Dimensional array we get results for the whole array\n",
    "- but we can also get it for different dimensions by specifying what *axis* we want\n",
    "- and ```np.argmax(myarray)``` or ```np.argmin(myarray)``` tell us where the biggest/smallest values are in the array\n",
    "\n",
    "The cell below illustrates how to use these - and also a handy function ```np.reshape()``` which re-organises things "
